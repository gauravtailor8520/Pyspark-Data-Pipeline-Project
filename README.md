# PySpark ETL Pipeline Project

Welcome to the **PySpark ETL Pipeline Project** repository. This project is designed to help data professionals enhance their skills in Apache Spark by working through scenario-based challenges that involve real-world data processing tasks.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project explores the process of creating robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using PySpark on Databricks. It includes various stages of data handling and processing, with a focus on leveraging best practices and advanced techniques in data engineering.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Data Ingestion:**
  - Implemented ETL pipelines using the Python API of Apache Spark (PySpark).
  - Utilized diverse data sources including CSV, Parquet, and Delta Tables.
  
- **Factory Pattern Implementation:**
  - Applied the Factory Pattern to create a modular and reusable reader class, enabling seamless handling of multiple data sources.
  
- **Data Transformation:**
  - Developed business transformation logic using PySpark DataFrame API and Spark SQL.
  - Implemented transformations such as filtering, aggregations, joins, and window functions.

- **Data Storage Solutions:**
  - Loaded and stored processed data using two approaches:
    - **DataLake:** Stored data in a centralized repository, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
    - **Data LakeHouse:** Combined the features of DataLake and data warehouse for enhanced performance and reliability.

- **Advanced PySpark Techniques:**
  - Demonstrated the use of broadcast joins, partitioning, and bucketing for optimized data processing.
  - Utilized window functions like `LAG` and `LEAD` for complex data operations.
  - Managed Delta Tables for versioned data storage and efficient updates.

### ðŸ’» Prerequisites

To run the code and replicate the project setup, youâ€™ll need:
- Basic knowledge of Python and SQL.
- Apache Spark installed locally or access to Databricks.
- Familiarity with PySpark and DataFrame API.
